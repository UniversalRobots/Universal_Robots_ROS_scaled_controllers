# Scaled controllers

This repository contains controllers and hardware interface for `ros_control` that are leveraging an
on-the-fly speed scaling mechanism. For example, they are used by the
[`ur_robot_driver`](http://wiki.ros.org/ur_robot_driver).

For this, the following subpackages exist:

  * A **speed_scaling_interface** to read the value of the current speed scaling into controllers.
  * A **speed_scaling_state_controller** that publishes the current execution speed as reported by
  the robot to a topic interface. Values are floating points between 0 and 1.
  * A **scaled_joint_trajectory_controller** that is similar to the *joint_trajectory_controller*,
  but it uses the speed scaling reported by the robot to reduce execution speed of the trajectory.
